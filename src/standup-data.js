    summary: "One person leaves standup and the rest of the team has to piece it all back together for them.",
    description: "One person leaves your standup call (or goes to get themselves some coffee if you're in an office). The team then nominates one person to give the missing person an update when they return. Standup then happens as usual without the missing person. When they come back, the nominated person has to fill them in.",
    benefits: [
      "Helps the team build awareness of the fact that not everyone will be at every standup and to consider how to communicate what happened in standup in an effective way. People are often missing at standup for other reasons (holidays, sick etc.). Might as well get good at it.",
      "Promotes listening skills as everyone else in the team is keen to see if the nominated person gets it right!",

    description: "Everyone except one team member leaves standup. The person left behind has five minutes to take a look at the board and try to understand the status of everyone's work. While they do this, it's fun for the rest of the team to chat together on a separate video call, or around the corner if everyone's in the same office.",
    benefits: [
      "Helps the team connect on a personal level",

    title: "Update a team mate",
    summary: "Get your whole team feeling involved by having each person update another",
    description: "Each person gives their update to the another person in the team, using their name and talking to them directly. E.g. “Natalie, yesterday I was working on X and today I’ll be doing Y”. Each person who receives an update picks the next person to give their update to. The last person then updates the first person.  (If people keep picking the same group of team mates to give their update, use a little spreadsheet or script to pick folks randomly.)",
    benefits: [
      "Helps build relationships because everyone in your team gets a chance to have a little conversation.",
      "Helps the team notice information asymmetry. E.g. it becomes very clear that a software engineer uses too much technical jargon in when they have to give their update directly to the visual designer on the team.",
      "This helps team members to focus on useful information. It’s easier to keep an update to the point when you’re talking to a particular person."

No one will know everything, but try to see if you can remember what they're doing and what they'll be working on next.",
    benefits: [
      "Builds empathy between team members - everyone is forced to peek into someone else's life",

Hopefully your team has something (a digital board? a spreadsheet?) that shows how you're doing on your overall goals (maybe it's for a financial quarter, maybe it's for a particular project).
